# Mathematical Playgrounds

**_A growing collection of mathematical models and explorations for budding mathematicians._** I have learned a lot since I first built this.

After completing a few other projects, I am returning to this project. I plan to rebuild and extend some of the current features as well as add new ones.

I recently (2/20/20) finished combining a few projects and migrating the whole site to Jekyll. This helped me be more efficient and repeat myself less. It also makes the site much easier to maintain.

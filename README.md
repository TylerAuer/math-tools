# Mathematical Playgrounds

**_A growing collection of mathematical models and explorations for budding mathematicians._** I have learned a lot since I first built this. 

After completing a few other projects, I am returning to this project. I plan to rebuild and extend some of the current features as well as add new ones.

## To Do List

- Itemize bugs and key goals and objectives within each currently built page
  - 100s Grid
    - Fix Sieve of Eratosthenes ( Watchable instead of instant )
    - Set limits on columns and rows
    - Skip count should work for negative numbers too
  - Multiplication Chart
    - Set limits on columns and rows
    - Add faint left and right borders to cells so big numbers can be read separately
    - Change font size as numbers get larger
  - Monte Carlo Activiites
    - Vertical axis should be percents not counts
    - Edit footer

## Future Things to Build

- 100s grid puzzles
  - Blank squares to fill based on a give
  - Sums of squares in a pattern
- Monte Carlo
  - Sum of 3 Dice
  - Poker Hands
  - Blackjack
  - Roulette
- Big Ideas
  - Broken Calculators
  - Random subitizing card generator
  - Ciphers and Codes
  - Visual Collatz Conjecture
  - XKCD Fruit Rating

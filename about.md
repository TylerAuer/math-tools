## About

I'm am math teacher interested in code and design. I like puzzling through ways to help others make sense of complex ideas. As I strengthen my coding skills, I'm working to create increasingly sophisticated and well-built apps. 

Much of what lives here is fairly old. It works, but the code isn't pretty. There's too many things done inefficiently, when I didn't know any better.

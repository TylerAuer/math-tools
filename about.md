## About

I'm a math teacher interested in code and design who likes to puzzle through ways to help others make sense of complex ideas. As I strengthen my coding skills, I'm working to create increasingly sophisticated and well-built apps. 

Much of what lives here is fairly old. It works, but the code isn't pretty. There are too many things done inefficiently, too much repeated code. I didn't know any better.

I've updated a few things here and there, but the goal is really to keep building new things with better practices and skills.

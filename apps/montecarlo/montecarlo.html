    <h2>Monte Carlo Simulations</h2>

    <p>This site runs <b>Monte Carlo Simulations</b> for common random events. While it may take you 10 seconds to roll
        a pair of dice or to flip a coin, most computers can simulate thousands of random events every second.</p>
    <p>Scientists and mathematicians use computers to simulate random events thousands of times (or more) in order to
        determine the experimental probability of a random event. They use this method to predict the outcome of
        sporting events, forecast the paths of hurricanes, and test new casino games.</p>
    <p>Monte Carlo simulations take advantage of the <b>Law of Large Numbers</b> which says that as you rerun a random
        event over-and-over-and-over, your results become more and more predictable.</p>

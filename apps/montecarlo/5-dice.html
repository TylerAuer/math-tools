        <h2>Sum of 5 Dice</h2>
        <p>
            Rolling a pair of dice is a common activity used to introduce students to probability. But, what if we went
            <b><i>CrAzY</i></b> and used 5 dice instead. What do you predict will happen?
        </p>
        <p>
            This site runs a <b>Monte Carlo Simulation</b> of rolling 5 dice. While it may take you 10 seconds
            for
            each roll, most computers can simulate thousands of rolls every second. Scientists and mathematicians use
            this
            method to predict the outcome of sporting events</a>, forecast the paths of hurricanes, and test new casino
            games.
        </p>
        <p>This method takes advantage of the <b>Law of Large Numbers</b> which says that as you rerun a random event
            over-and-over-and-over, your results become more and more predictable.</p>

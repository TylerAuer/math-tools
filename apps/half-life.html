        There are 10,000 dots on this page. When you hit the start button, they will all begin to turn white. This is
        meant to simulate a phenomenon known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay">radioactive
            decay</a>.</p>
    <p>
        The <b>rate of decay</b> of a material is described with something called <b>half-life</b>. The half-life of a
        material is how long it takes, on average, for half of the atoms in the material to decay. Not all materials
        decay, only matter with unstable atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some materials have a very long half-life,
        while others are very short. <b>Uranium-235</b>, an isotope often used in nuclear weapons, has a half-life of
        703,800,000 <b>years</b>! While Boron-19 has a half-life of only 0.00292 <b>seconds</b>.
